# NIH STRIDES Initiative

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) [STRIDES Initiative](https://datascience.nih.gov/strides), one of many NIH-wide efforts to implement the [NIH Strategy for Data Science](https://datascience.nih.gov/strategicplan), is designed to enhance biomedical discovery and improve efficiency through new digital data management strategies that contribute to NIH efforts to develop and sustain a modern biomedical data ecosystem.

Through partnerships with commercial cloud providers, the STRIDES Initiative provides a cost-effective way for biomedical researchers at NIH-funded institutions to access rich datasets and the most advanced computational infrastructure, tools, and services provided by STRIDES Initiative partners. The overall goal of the initiative is to accelerate biomedical advances by reducing economic and technological barriers for accessing data and resources.

## Enrollment Considerations

NIH-funded biomedical researchers are eligible to leverage the STRIDES Initiative to access cutting-edge cloud services and tools, which includes access to favorable pricing on industry-leading commercial cloud environments from STRIDES Initiative partners, such as [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/). In addition to access the broad catalogs of cloud services, NIH-funded researchers have access to consulting resources, training, and billing assistance to facilitate data computation, storage, sharing, analysis, and sustainability.

The following documents can help to inform decision-makers determine whether the STRIDES Initiative is right for their institutions:

- [Steps to Get Started with the STRIDES Initiative](files/Steps-to-Get-Started-with-the-STRIDES-Initiative.pdf)
- [STRIDES Initiative Frequently Asked Questions](files/STRIDES-Initiative-Frequently-Asked-Questions.pdf)

NIH and the STRIDES Initiative partners have dedicated teams to help institutions decide whether and how this service can benefit their NIH-funded researchers. Additional resources and support are available to help move through the onboarding process smoothly. STRIDES Initiative partners will also work with institutions directly to get set up to use cloud services and tools.

## What's Next?

If you have questions or would like more information on how to get started, please contact the NIH STRIDES Initiative team at STRIDES@nih.gov. It will help to indicate whether you have a preference for AWS, Google Cloud, or both, so that the STRIDES team can follow up with the most relevant materials and points of contact for progressing through the onboarding process.
